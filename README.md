# social-network-api

A social network API built with node.js, express.js, monogoose, and MongoDB

### Description
The attached project file(s) are for our eighteenth challenge as part of the UC Berkeley full stack coding bootcamp. The goal of the challenge was to build the back end API for a social network that allows for creation, deletion, and updating of a user, that user's thoughts, and reactions to that user's thoughts.

The project gave me experience building with Mongoose and MongoDB, allowing me to understand how to use express.js API routes to create relationships between data in a NoSQL database.

### Installation
In order to use the application, clone the GitHub repository link, start the application using node, then create seed data using an API platform such as Insomnia or Postman.

### Usage
This application is free to use.

### Credits
This project was created with helpful collaboration from bootcamp group 3, as well as my instructors, TAs, and my tutor (Erik Hirsch) from UC Berkeley.
